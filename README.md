# Control-Volume-By-Hand
## A simple python script that allows the user to control their pc's volume using hand gestures.

This program utilizes two essential packages: OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning library, and pycaw, Python's Core Audio Windows Library. To execute the program successfully, you need to download the two files: "VolumeHandControl.py" (the main script) and "HandTrackingModule.py" (a module that is imported on the main script) and place them in the same folder. Once this setup is complete, running the "VolumeHandControl.py" script will initiate the functionality.
