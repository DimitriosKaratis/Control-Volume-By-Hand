# Control-Volume-By-Hand
## A simple python script that allows the user to control their PC's volume using hand gestures.

This program utilizes two essential packages: OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning library, and pycaw, Python's Core Audio Windows Library. To execute the program successfully, you'll need to download the two files: "VolumeHandControl.py" (the main script) and "HandTrackingModule.py" (a module that is imported on the main script) and place them in the same folder. Once this setup is complete, running the "VolumeHandControl.py" script will initiate the functionality. By employing a hand gesture in front of your computer's camera involving your thumb and index fingers, you can easily control the PC's volume. The program will display a black line in response to this gesture. To adjust the volume, simply change the length of that line using your hand. Decreasing the line's length lowers the volume, while increasing it raises the volume.
